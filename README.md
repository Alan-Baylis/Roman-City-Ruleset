The Roman City Ruleset is a library of procedural rules for [Esri CityEngine](http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine). It comprises a set of building typologies that can be stylistically adjusted to create Hellenistic, Etruscan, and Roman cities. 

The ruleset is a project started by [Marie Salda√±a](http://www.mariesaldana.com) in 2010 and was developed for archaeological and architectural reconstruction and research. To date, it has been used to model [early Rome](http://etc.ucla.edu/projects/romelab/), [Augustan Rome](http://etc.ucla.edu/projects/augustan-rome/), [Nysa](http://www.mariesaldana.com/portfolio/nysa/) and [Magnesia on the Maeander](http://www.mariesaldana.com/portfolio/magnesia/) in Turkey, and [Rhodes](http://www.mariesaldana.com/portfolio/rhodes/) in Greece.
