The Roman City Ruleset is a library of procedural rules for [Esri CityEngine](http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine). It comprises a set of building typologies that can be stylistically adjusted to create Hellenistic, Etruscan, and Roman cities. 

The ruleset was begun in 2010 by [Marie Salda√±a](http://www.mariesaldana.com/about/) and was developed for archaeological and architectural reconstruction and research. To date, it has been used to model [early Rome](http://etc.ucla.edu/projects/romelab/), [Augustan Rome](http://etc.ucla.edu/projects/augustan-rome/), [Nysa](http://www.mariesaldana.com/portfolio/nysa/) and [Magnesia on the Maeander](http://www.mariesaldana.com/portfolio/magnesia/) in Turkey, and [Rhodes](http://www.mariesaldana.com/portfolio/rhodes/) in Greece.

The ruleset is not intended to be comprehensive and reflects the priorities and resource constraints of the projects for which it was developed. Likewise, the rules were developed for architectural research rather than high-end visualization and I have made little attempt at the finer points of texture and ornamental detail. The main idea has been to lay a groundwork for an ever more robust set of rules as they are applied to new sites and projects.

For more information on how the ruleset has been used as part of a research workflow, see this [paper](http://www.mariesaldana.com/dh2014/). Also see this [tutorial](https://github.com/mariegsaldana/Roman-City-Ruleset/wiki/ArcGIS__CityEngine__Unity:-Workflow-Tutorial) on creating CityEngine scenes from ArcGIS data and exporting to Unity.

The following is a list of the current rules. They follow a modular - hierarchical structure. Building Type rules aggregate smaller rules for architectural components, such as colonnades, entablatures, and roofs. At the base level is a rule that controls the import of various non-procedural assets (such as column capitals) and textures.

Before using the ruleset, see [this page](https://github.com/mariegsaldana/Roman-City-Ruleset/wiki/How-to-Use-the-Roman-City-Ruleset) for general instructions. You can also click on each of the rules below for specific tips.
